In order to start this project you need to download and start two seperate projects located in the those two repositories:

Frontend part: https://github.com/martikaragy/social-alien-front-end

Backend part: https://github.com/martikaragy/socail-alien-app

After you run the backend server, you can start also the web application by typing `ng serve` in the dev console. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
